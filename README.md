### Introduction
This repository serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in Java development. It covers basic Java syntax, object-oriented programming, advanced Java topics, and practical applications through mini-projects with GUI interfaces.

## Basic Programs

These programs are designed for beginners to understand the fundamental concepts of Java:

Hello World: Basic introduction to Java syntax.

Control Flow: Programs using loops (for, while) and conditionals (if-else, switch).

Arrays and Strings: Examples of array manipulation and string handling.

Functions and Recursion: Programs demonstrating the use of functions and recursion.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Advanced Programs

These programs dive deeper into advanced concepts and problem-solving techniques:

Multithreading: Examples of Java's threading model and concurrency handling.

File I/O: Working with files and directories using Javaâ€™s file I/O capabilities.

Collections Framework: Programs demonstrating the use of Java's built-in data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Exception Handling: Proper error handling using try-catch-finally blocks and custom exceptions.

Lambda Expressions and Streams: Functional programming techniques in Java.

Networking: Programs using Java's networking libraries to create server-client applications.

## Mini Projects

These are complete mini-projects using Java Swing and Java 2D Graphics to build GUI-based applications:

Calculator: A simple calculator application using Java Swing components like JButton, JTextField, and event handling.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A GUI-based implementation of the classic game using Java Swing.

University Management System: A project to manage student records with functionalities like adding, updating, and deleting students.

Snake Game: An interactive Snake game created with Java Swing where players control a snake to collect food and grow while avoiding collisions.

Brick Breaker: A fun Brick Breaker game developed using Java Swing where players bounce a ball to break bricks and clear levels.

Getting Started

## To get started with this repository:

Ensure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code to open the project files.

### How to Run
To run any program:

Open the respective .java file in your IDE.

### Compile the file:
javac filename.java

Run the file:
java filename
For Swing or Java UI projects:

Navigate to the project directory and run the Main class.
Ensure you have the correct libraries installed and configured in your IDE for Java Swing and GUI components.
